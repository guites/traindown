Traindown
=========

**A language to help athletes express their training. Inspired by [Markdown.](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**

Traindown was created to help you easily capture all the things you do in a training session. It aims to provide you with a flexible, easy to remember language for expressing your training for record keeping purposes. As you will learn, writing out your training in **Traindown** is as simple as using a hashtag.

This repo contains all the goodies present on the [Official Traindown Website](https://traindown.com). Feel free to correct my typos!
